# Energy Consumption Forecasting Challenge

## Overview

Energy consumption forecasting plays a pivotal role in optimizing energy resources, reducing costs, and minimizing environmental impact. This repository presents solutions for the Energy Consumption Forecasting Challenge using multiple predictive modeling techniques implemented in separate notebooks. Each approach leverages a unique method for analyzing and predicting energy consumption.

## Repository Structure

The repository contains the following key components:

### ðŸ“‚ Notebooks

1. **`prophet_forecasting.ipynb`**

   - Utilizes Facebook's Prophet library for time series forecasting.
   - Incorporates seasonality, holidays, and trend detection to generate predictions.

2. **`lstm_forecasting.ipynb`**

   - Implements Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks for deep learning-based time series prediction.
   - Designed to capture complex temporal dependencies in energy consumption data.

3. **`skforecast_forecasting.ipynb`**
   - Uses the Skforecast library for regression-based forecasting.
   - Employs autoregressive models with feature engineering for precise predictions.

### ðŸ“‚ Data

- **`train_energy.csv`**: Historical energy consumption data for model training.
- **`test_energy.csv`**: Timestamp data for which predictions are required.
- **`sample_submission.csv`**: Template for submission with DateTime and predicted `EnergyConsumption(kWh)` values.

### ðŸ“‚ Outputs

- **`predictions/`**: Contains prediction files generated by each method in the required submission format.

### ðŸ“„ `README.md`

Comprehensive documentation for understanding and utilizing the repository.

## Requirements

To run the notebooks, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.8+
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required libraries:
  ```bash
  pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn tensorflow prophet skforecast holidays
  ```

---

## Workflow

### 1. Data Exploration and Preprocessing

- Analyze patterns, trends, and anomalies in `train_energy.csv`.
- Handle missing values and outliers.
- Perform feature engineering, including:
  - Extracting components such as hour, day, week, and month.
  - Adding holiday indicators using the `holidays` library.

### 2. Model Building

#### Prophet

- Set up seasonal, trend, and holiday components.
- Train on historical data to capture long-term patterns.

#### LSTM

- Preprocess data into sequences suitable for deep learning.
- Build and train an LSTM model with TensorFlow/Keras.
- Optimize hyperparameters for better results.

#### Skforecast

- Generate lagged features and autoregressive terms.
- Train regression-based models for time series prediction.
- Use hyperparameter tuning to enhance performance.

### 3. Prediction

- Apply trained models to the testing dataset.
- Generate predictions for `EnergyConsumption(kWh)`.

### 4. Submission

- Save predictions in the `sample_submission.csv` format.
- Ensure `DateTime` entries match `test_energy.csv`.

## Evaluation

The models are evaluated using the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE):

\[
RMSE = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n} \sum\_{i=1}^n (y_i - \hat{y}\_i)^2}
\]

Where:

- \( y_i \): Actual energy consumption.
- \( \hat{y}\_i \): Predicted energy consumption.
- \( n \): Number of predictions.

## Results

| Method     | Public RMSE | Private RMSE |
| ---------- | ----------- | ------------ |
| Prophet    | XX.XX       | XX.XX        |
| LSTM       | XX.XX       | XX.XX        |
| Skforecast | XX.XX       | XX.XX        |
